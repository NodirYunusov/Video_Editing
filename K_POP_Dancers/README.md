### Command I run on anaconda prompt:
python video_editing1.py --video_path "D:\Projects\video\unprocessed\2.mp4" --save_path "D:\Projects\video\1_video\output_video\output.mp4"

1) video_editing1.py - is my code
2) --video_path - is where my unprocessed file located
3) --save_path is a path of my output video

### Please Pay Attention. I am sharing a link which leads you to my drive where I saved both unprocessed and edited (output) video. Feel free to visit!
